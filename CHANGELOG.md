## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- **Hierarchical States**: Compound/nested states with parent-child relationships
- **Event Bubbling**: Events unhandled by child states bubble up to ancestors
- **Proper Entry/Exit Ordering**: Leaf-to-root exit, root-to-leaf entry
- **Self-Transition Support**: External transition semantics (exit and re-enter)
- **XState JSON Exporter**: Export machines for visualization with Stately.ai
- **Pedestrian Light Example**: Demonstrates hierarchical states and event bubbling
- `Matches()` now returns true for ancestor states
- `UpdateContext()` method for modifying interpreter context

### Changed

- `Start()` now recursively enters nested initial states to reach leaf state
- Transition resolution now uses Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) algorithm
